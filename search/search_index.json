Android \u00b6 Note Note to pre-existing QField users: for security reasons, Google has since November 2021 enforced a new set of storage access rules which prohibits most applications from directly accessing files in most locations on a device\u2018s internal and external storages. To work within this new confine, QField has to import projects and datasets into its Google-specified storage location within which QField has unrestricted read/write access. Instructions below should guide users' migration to the new paragdim. Opening projects and datasets \u00b6 QField can open projects and datasets in three ways: by importing a project folder; by importing a compressed project file; and by importing individual dataset(s). QField import actions These actions are available via the dropdown action menu in the project/dataset picker\u2018s plus button, which can be accessed by clicking on the \u2018Open local files\u2019 button located in QField\u2018s welcome screen. Importing a project folder \u00b6 When importing a project through the \"Import project from folder\" action, users will be asked to grant permission for QField to read the content of a given folder on the device\u2019s storage via a system folder picker. When the folder is selected, QField copies the folder content (including its sub-folders) into its \u2018Imported projects\u2019 location. Users can then open and interact with the project from there. Re-importing a given folder through the drop-down menu action will overwrite preexisting projects given an identical folder name. That allows users to be able to update projects. Note Feature editing, addition, and deletion will be saved into the imported project\u2019s datasets, not in the original folder selected during the import process. See sections below on how to send/export edited projects and datasets. Importing a compressed project \u00b6 Projects can be imported into QField by being provided a project compressed into a ZIP archive. When choosing the \u2018Import project from ZIP\u2019 action, users will be asked to select a ZIP file on their device\u2018s storage. QField will then decompress the file into its \u2018Imported projects\u2019 location. Users can then open and interact with the project from there. This can greatly ease remote deployment of projects by being able to send a single file to users. Importing individual dataset(s) The \u2018Import dataset(s)\u2018 action allows users to select one or more datasets via an Android system file picker. Upon selecting the datasets, QField will copy those into the \u2018Imported datasets\u2019 folder, where users can then open and modify their content. Note Users will have to ensure that all sidecar files are selected when importing datsets (e.g. a shapefile would require users to select the .shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj, and .cpg files). Exporting modified projects and datasets \u00b6 Once users modify imported projects and datasets, QField offer various means through which the content can be sent from and exported out of its system-protected files storage: by exporting a project folder or an individual dataset; by sending a compressed project folder to a {cloud, email, messenger, etc.} app; by sending an individual dataset to a {cloud, email, messenger, etc.} app; and by accessing imported content directly through USB cable. QField export actions These actions are available via the dropdown action menu attached to project folders and individual datasets list in the project/dataset picker, which can be accessed by clicking on the \u2018Open local files\u2018 button located in QField\u2019s welcome screen. Exporting a project folder or an individual dataset \u00b6 When choosing the \u2018Export to folder\u2018 action, users will be asked to pick a location - using the Android system\u2018s folder picker activity - within which the content of a select project folder or individual dataset will be copied to. This action can be used to copy the content of modified projects or datasets into a folder on the device that can be accessed by third-party synchronization apps such as Syncthing, or directly copy content into cloud accounts of providers that support Android\u2018s Scoped Storage directory provider (at the time of writing, only NextCloud app has such support). Note Exporting onto a folder will overwrite preexisting content. Sending a compressed project folder \u00b6 The \u2018Send compressed folder to\u2018 action compresses the content of a selected folder into a ZIP archive. Users are then asked through which app on their device the resulting ZIP archive should be send through. Users can compress and send whole projects by selecting root folders in QField\u2018s \u2018Imported projects\u2018 directory, as well as send selective folders within project folders. This allows for users to narrow down the compressed files to e.g. a /DCIM subfolder. Sending an individual dataset \u00b6 Users can select the \u2018Send to\u2018 action for individuald datasets, allowing for the sending of edited datasets directly to third party apps such as Gmail, Drive, Dropbox, Nextcloud, , etc. Accessing imported content directly through USB cable \u00b6 Imported projects and datasets can be accessed directly using a USB cable. The location is displayed in the top navigation bar of the project/dataset picker. On most devices plugged into a computer via USB cable connection, the path will be <drive>:/Android/data/ch.opengis.qfield/files/ . Users will find both the Imported Datasets and Imported Projects folders within which the imported projects and datasets will be located.

Do not hesitate to check it out. Supported vector providers \u00b6 Currently, QFieldCloud supports GeoPackage and PostGIS layers for collaborative editing. Other formats supported by QGIS should also work but are not officially supported. Working with GeoPackages \u00b6 Using GeoPackages is usually the best choice for a simple setup to centralize data collected by your QField users to one single file. If you would like to set up relations, it is recommended to add a UUID field on your tables, and to use that as a foreign key instead of geoPackage's fid , as they are subject to change to avoid conflicts if two users create new records at the same time. Example worklow (GeoPackage) \u00b6 Setup on QGIS desktop: Create a new project. Create a GeoPackage layers, save it in the same folder than the QGIS project. Set the GeoPackage to \"Offline editing\" in the QFieldSync plugin. Upload the project to QField cloud. Collect data on the device with QField: Open QFieldCloud and import the project. Collect some data and upload the changes. Download results on QGIS desktop: In QFieldSync, download the updated files (the GeoPackage file should have changed). Attention This workflow does not support changing the GeoPackage on the desktop, as being file base, the whole GeoPackage will be replaced. This means that data can only be digitized using QFieldCloud. PostGIS \u00b6 Using PostGIS layers is a good choice if you want data from your QField users to be updated directly in your database by QFieldCloud when they sync their work without further step. It requires your database to be publicly accessible and credentials must be saved unencrypted in the QGIS project. Please be aware of the security implications of such requirements, and remember to have backups. Example workflow (PostGIS) \u00b6 Setup on QGIS desktop: Create a new project. Create add a PostGIS layer, making sure to store the credentials in the project. Make sure the PostGIS database connection is publicly accessible (public IP or domain name, it will not work with 127.0.0.1 or localhost). In the QFieldSync project settings, set the GeoPackage to Offline editing if your QField users will not have a reliable internet connection in the field or Direct database access . Upload the project to QField cloud. Collect data on the device with QField: Open QFieldCloud and import the project. Collect some data (and upload the changes once back at the office if you were using Offline editing ). See results on QGIS desktop: All changes should be directly visible on the PostGIS database. Note When using direct database access , QFieldCloud will directly edit data on the PostGIS database. This will only work with a reliable internet connection in the field, but has the advantage that all data is directly visible to all users and allows to use any PostGIS specific setup (triggers, generated fields, etc). Note When using offline editing , QField will work on a local copy of the database in a GeoPackage, which will be synced by QFieldCloud to the original database. This is the best choice if the connection in the field is not reliable. Changes will only be visible to users once they sync to QFieldCloud. As a local copy is created, advanced PostGIS features will not be available on QField. Just like for regular GeoPackages, if you define relationships, it is recommended to use UUIDs instead of integer primary keys to avoid conflicts if multiple users create data at the same time.","title":"Advanced Setup"},{"location":"get-started/tutorials/advanced-setup-qfc/#advanced-setup-guide","text":"Help We have a community discussion platform to discuss your questions, doubts and ideas.

Configuring the offline editing functionality and synchronizing changes back. Workflow \u00b6 To get a quick overview of the process, here is a list of typical steps: Create a QField package. This is a working copy in a separate folder. Copy the QField package to the target device. Go out and collect data. Copy the modified data back to your desktop computer. Synchronize the modified data with your database or files. Installation \u00b6 In QGIS, open the plugin library and search for qfield sync . Select the plugin in the list and click on Install . QField Sync in QGIS plugin repository Configuration \u00b6 The project configuration is saved in the master .qgs project file. This way it is possible to pre-configure a project once and use it repeatedly. Configure project Layer configuration \u00b6 Configure the project layers In the project configuration dialog, an action can be defined for each layer individually. Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available. Copy The layer will be copied to the package folder. This is only available for file-based layers. No action The layer source will be left untouched. This is only available for non-file-based layers like WMS, WFS, Postgis... Offline editing A working copy of the layer is copied into the package folder. Every change which is done in the packaged project during work is recorded in a changelog. When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project. Base map configuration \u00b6 A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer. Offline editing configuration \u00b6 If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy. Package for QField \u00b6 Once the project is configured, package it in a folder. This folder will contain the .qgs and the data used in it. Package the project for QField Copy the folder on your device. Open QField, open the project and start collecting data. Make also sure to save the QGIS project using the regular Save As of QGIS as you'll have to re-open it later when you want to synchronize the changes. Synchronize from QField \u00b6 When you want to synchronize what you have collected, re-open the project in QGIS (the one you saved with a regular Save As). Copy the project folder from your device to your computer and use the Synchronize from QField menu to synchronize your changes from the protable project to the main project.

The field widgets from QGIS are supported on a best effort basis and optimized for the mobile use. Widget type Support Notes Text Edit - HTML is not supported - Numerical input is enforced based on the type. Check Box Value Map Hidden Attachment This field is combined with camera integration. It is also able to open other files like pdf and doc (if you have an appropriate viewer) Attachment (photo settings) Date Time Range Relation Reference Relation Widget Value Relation UUID Generator QML / HTML Widget Others Funding Editable \u00b6 The editable flag of fields is respected. Remember last values \u00b6 QField offers a much more fine-grained control over the last used values and ignores the QGIS setting. Suppress attribute form \u00b6 The setting suppress attribute form is directly applied to the QField form. Drag and drop designer forms \u00b6 Groups and Tabs from Drag and Drop designer forms are supported. Configure a Relation Widget \u00b6 Desktop preparation For more information refer to the relations chapter of the official QGIS Documentation . The relation widget shows all the referencing child features in a list. It is possible to add, delete and open them. The visual identification of the list entries are done via the Display Expression of the child layer. Key handling \u00b6 Since the parents primary keys are used as foreign keys on the referencing child features, these primary keys must be save to use even after the synchronization back to the original data. Therefore we recommend to use stable values such as UUIDs for primary keys. It is possible to already add children from a parent that is about to be added. This possibility will be blocked if there is no valid primary key on the parent or the constraints are violated. In case the adding of the parent feature is canceled after some children have been added already, the children are deleted as well. Many-To-Many relations \u00b6 On many-to-many relationships, according to the cardinality setting in the QGIS Vector Layer Properties , on adding, deleting or opening an entry in the list effects directly the child layer (on direct cardinality) or the linking table (on many-to-one cardinality). The second case is usually used when there are additional relation information (e.g. percentage) in the linking table. In case of the many-to-one cardinality on many-to-many relations the Display Expression needs to be set on the linking table. Configure Attachment/Pictures Widget \u00b6 Desktop preparation The widget type Attachment is used with fields that store the path to files. It can be used to: show and take photos show links to external files like pdfs or documents The path should be set to relative. The pictures, pdf and docs are stored then in a sub-directory of the project, where the link stored in the textfield is pointing to. In QField the picture is displayed. By clicking the camera symbol the camera is started to update the picture with a new photo. pictures On synchronization the sub-directory with the pictures, pdf and docs has to be copied as well. The option hyperlink on the attachment widget will disable the camera functionality and enable a hyperlink to open a document (pdf, doc, ...). Configure a Value Relation Widget \u00b6 Desktop preparation The widget Value Relation offers values from a related table in a combobox. You can select layer , key column and value column . Several options are available to change the standard behaviors: allow null value , order by value and allow multiple selections . The widget will display a drop-down or multiple-select list of the referenced features. Configure Conditional Visibility \u00b6 Desktop preparation Groups can be hidden based on an expression. This is useful when certain attributes are only required under certain conditions. As an example imagine mapping trees. Some of them might have a disease and you have a list of possible deseases. To not clutter the form with many fields, make a group and configure a visibility expression for a group \"diseases\". Add a field \"desease\" with a checkbox. Only when the checkbox is checked, the list of diseases will be available to you. Configuration of a group box that will only be shown if the checkbox \"measures_taken\" is checked. Let's see what we got on the field: Define Constraints \u00b6 Desktop preparation Attribute fields can have constraints attached. Constraints are expressions that needs to evaluate to True (or 1 ) in order to be able to save the form. Constraints are configured on a per-field basis and a description can be added that will be shown if a constraint is not satisfied. Configuration of a constraint within a range Common use cases \u00b6 You cannot enter an elevation value higher than the highest mountain in this country. \"elevation\" < 5000 It is required to fill in an identifier. \"identifier\" IS NOT NULL Define Default Values \u00b6 Desktop preparation Fields can have default values configured. Default values are inserted into the attribute form when digitizing a new feature. They are visible and can be modified as long as the field is editable. They can be based on the geometry or expression variables. Configuration of a formatted date as default value Additional variables \u00b6 For more information regarding storing information related to your position in object attributes, refer to the deticated GNSS documentation .

Collect features \u00b6 Fieldwork To start digitizing new features, enable the Edit mode by clicking on the pencil icon in the side dashboard and selecting the layer within which you want to add new features. The current layer within which features are to be added is highlighted in green. Adding point features \u00b6 Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired location and click the Plus (+) button at the lower right of the screen to confirm the creation of a new point feature. You can use the lock to position button to force the crosshair to center on your location if you have enabled positioning. Adding line or polygon features \u00b6 Navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired start of the line or polygon and click the Plus (+) button at the lower right of the screen to add the first node. Proceed with adding points to form you line or polygon by clicking the Plus (+) button each time you want to add a new node. Click the Minus (-) button to remove the last added node. When you have added a least 2 nodes for a line or 3 nodes for a polygon, a Save button will appear. Click on it to finish your geometry. While digitizing, you can click the (x) button to cancel the current feature creation. Note QField insures that digitized geometries will not have duplicate vertices and respects the geometry precision settings from the currently selected layer. Attribute form \u00b6 After digitizing a geometry, the attribute form will appear allowing you to edit attribute values for the newly-added feature. Note You can supress the attribute form upon feature addition via a configuration option for a given layer via its properties dialog in QGIS Remember attribute values \u00b6 For quick collection of rather homogeneus datasets, it is crucial to not having to enter the same attribute values over an over. The checkboxes at the right of every attribute allow remembering of the last entered value for each attribute individually so that the next time you will add a feature on the same layer, these attributes will be automatically pre-filled. Geometry editing \u00b6 Fieldwork To edit the geometry of pre-existing features, enable the Edit mode by tapping on the pencil icon in QField's side dashboard. Once in edit mode, a new Edit geometry button will appear in the title bar of an identified feature form. Clicking on the button will activate the geometry editor environment which offers four tools: A vertex editor tool; A geometry split tool; A geometry reshape tool; and A geometry ring tool. Vertex tool \u00b6 The vertex editor allows you to move or delete pre-existing vertices as well as adding new vertices to geometries. Split tool \u00b6 The split tool allows you to split line and polygon geometries into two halves, one of which will become a new feature of its own. Reshape tool \u00b6 The reshape tool allows you to change line and polygon geometries by drawing shapes which will result a reshaped line following the edge of the drawn shape or a polygon with the drawn shapped used to clip or expand the geometry. Ring tool \u00b6 The ring tool allows you to digitize rings (i.e. holes) into polygon geometries. Once a ring is created, QField will offer the possibility of filling the ring with a new feature. Demonstration of geometries editing \u00b6 A video demonstration of some editing possibilities: Merging features \u00b6 QField allows you to merge features and their geometries into a single feature. To do so, identify two (or more) features on the map, select them in the features list and merge them by selecting the Merge Selected Features in the Menu (\u205d) Button . Freehand digitizing \u00b6 The freehand digitizing mode allows you to \"draw\" lines and polygons using their stylus pen or mouse. The mode is available for line and polygon feature additions as well as the above-mentioned geometry editor's rings, split, and reshape tools. The freehand digitizing mode is activated through a new toolbar button which appears when QField is set to editing mode and a stylus pen or a mouse is hovering the map canvas while a line or polygon vector is selected. Topological editing \u00b6 If topological editing is activated on the project QGIS before exporting for QField, shared nodes of neighbouring geometries are modified together when moving / deleting vertices and additional vertices are added to segments when a new node is added from neightbouring geometries. Multi-editing of attributes \u00b6 QField allows you to select multiple features and edit their attributes all at once. In some cases, it can result in very efficient worflows. To do so, identify two (or more) features on the map, select them in the features list and merge them by selecting the Edit feature button in the list's title bar. Delete features \u00b6 Fieldwork Deleting a feature is done by selecting the Delete feature action in the feature form's 3-dot menu . QField also allows you to delete multiple features at a time. To do so, first identify the features by short tapping on the relevant parts of the map. Then activate the multi-selection mode by long pressing on one of the features you want to delete.

GNSS devices are also capable of measuring the altitude next to the current 2D position on the earth surface. Visualization \u00b6 When positioning is activated, your position will be shown in blue on the map. Your location is visible either as a blue dot if you are still or as an arrow indicating your movement direction if you are moving.

If you are using altitude correction and an external bluetooth connected antenna consider turning Use orthometric altitude from device off. Additional variables \u00b6 You can get access to positioning information through additional expression variables. These will only be available when positioning is enabled. These variables are commonly used as default values for fields to keep track of the quality of individual measured points. @position_source_name - The name of the device that gave location information as reported by the sensor. To differenciate between internal and external sensor. If the position is manually set, and the position is not snapped to the cursor, the source name is \"manual\". In case the cursor is not snapped to the position, all other variables will be null, if you need this, use the gnss_ variables instead . @position_quality_description - A human readable and translated string for the quality as reported by the sensor. E.g. \"Fixed RTK\". It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_coordinate - A point with the coordinate in WGS84. Lon, Lat, Altitude as delivered by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - x(@position_coordinate) - IE @position_horizontal_accuracy - The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters) as reported by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_timestamp - The timestamp of the position in UTC as reported by the sensor.

It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_ground_speed - Groundspeed (in m/s) as reported by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_magnetic_variation - The angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and true north, in degrees as reported by the sensor. Also known as magnetic declination. A positive value indicates a clockwise direction from true north and a negative value indicates a counter-clockwise direction. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_vertical_accuracy - The vertical accuracy of the coordinate (in meters) as reported by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_3d_accuracy - The 3 dimensional accuracy of the coordinate (in meters), 3D-RMS as reported by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_vertical_speed - The vertical speed (in m/s) as reported by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - IE @position_averaged_count - This variable holds the number of collected positions from which an averaged position was calculated when digitizing in this mode. For non-averaged positions, the value will be set to 0 (zero). - IE @position_pdop - Position dilution of precision as reported by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - E @position_hdop - Horizontal dilution of precision as reported by the sensor. It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - E @position_vdop - Vertical dilution of precision as reported by the sensor.

It is only available when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor. - E Info I: Internal position source E: External (NMEA) position source All @position_* variables have a corresponding @gnss_* variable. The gnss variables always report the gnss sensor values, even when the crosshair is not snapped. Examples: when the crosshair is snapped to the sensor - @gnss_horizontal_accuracy > The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters) as reported by the sensor. - @position_horizontal_accuracy > The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters) as reported by the sensor. - @position_source_name --> sensor name. when the crosshair is manually moved - @gnss_horizontal_accuracy > The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters) as reported by the sensor. - @position_horizontal_accuracy > The value is NULL . - @position_source_name > The value is manual . Usage \u00b6 Fieldwork A short press on the GNSS button will turn on the GNSS and center to the current location once positioning information is available. Activate edit mode and press on the target button, the cross in the center means it is using GNSS positioning. A long press on the GNSS button will show the positioning menu . Inside the positioning menu you can turn on the positioning display which will show the current coordinates which are reprojected into the project CRS along with precision information. Note If you see WGS 84 lat/lon information instead of information in your project CRS, you probably have no signal yet. Using an external GNSS-Receiver \u00b6 Fieldwork QField supports connecting external GNSS antennas via bluetooth. In Settings > Positioning , paired bluetooth devices can be scanned and chosen as position source. Make sure no other app like mock location providers are using the bluetooth antenna. Mock location \u00b6 Fieldwork It is possible to provide a mock location via a separate android app to QField. There are several options for this, one of them is Android NTRIP Client . To use this you have to enable mock locations on your Android device . Averaged positioning functionality \u00b6 Fieldwork Note The coordinate cursor must be locked to the current location via the Lock to position button There is a function that allows you to digitize using averaged positions. The survey will start by pressing and holding the add vertex button, which will start collecting positions. While collecting, an indicator will appear on top of the coordinate cursor showing a text reflecting the current number of collected positions. If an averaged position minimum count requirement is active, a progress bar will also be present indicating the progress towards meeting that requirement. To setting to activate an average position minimum count threshold can be found in QField settings's positioning panel. When active, holding the add vertex button is not required, a short tap on the button will begin the collection of positions and automatically add the averaged position when the minimum count requirement is met. When using @gnss_* or @position_ variables on averaged positions, the variable will also represent the average over all collected samples.","title":"Positioning (GNSS)"},{"location":"how-to/gnss/#positioning-gnss","text":"QField can make use of the internal GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System, like GPS, GLONASS, Galileo or Beidou).

Activating navigation \u00b6 Navigation is enabled when a destination point has been set and positioning is active. When turned on, a set of navigation overlays - a destination marker, a navigation panel, and a navigation control button - appear over the map. The navigation panel displays useful information such as the destination point coordinates as well as the current distance and bearing to destination. To disable navigation, clear the destination point by tap and holding on the navigation control button located at the lower right corner. Setting a destination point \u00b6 Fieldwork QField offers several methods to set a navigation destination point. A quick way is to simply tap and hold on any part of the map and select the Set as Destination action within the popped up menu. You can also set the navigation destination point by typing in specific coordinates in the search bar and tapping on the resulting flag navigation icon. You can also search for a specific feature and tap on the flag navigation icon which will also be present in the resulting list of features. You can also set a navigation destination point by opening the feature form menu and selecting the Set Feature as Destination action. Finally, you can also set a navigation destination using a feature, a purple feature bar title appears as part of the navigation information panel. For single points, a destination name is displayed (matching a given vector layer's display name field / expression). For multipoint or {multi,single}{line,polygon}, new navigation buttons are located at the left and right of the destination name. Those buttons allow users to cycle through vertices of the feature picked as navigation destination. Tap and holding onto these buttons will cycle through vertices (comes in handy when you have a feature with a large vertex count). Auto tracking of current location and destination \u00b6 Fieldwork QField allows for its map to automatically keep track of the current device location and destination and re-center the map extent around those two points. To activate this auto tracking feature, you can simply tap on the positioning button and the navigation control button. Both buttons should show their auto tracking mode active by having their background color turn to blue and purple. This can be described as a simple staking mode functionality. \"Stakeout\" precise view \u00b6 Fieldwork QField's \"stakeout\" precise view panel appears when the distance between the current location and the destination is less than a pre-defined threshold (by default 5 meters) and the positioning device has an accuracy that is less than half of that threshold. The precise view visibility threshold value can be modified by long-pressing on the bottom-right navigation button and selecting the Precise View Settings menu item. The precise view will turn green when the current location is considered to have hit the target. This state considers both the positioning device accuracy as well as the precise view threshold value, whereas QField will consider having hit the target when the distance between the current location and the destination minus the positioning device's accuracy is less than 1/10th of the precise view threshold. E.g.: if your precise view threshold is set to 1 meter and your positioning device accuracy is 0.05 meter, the view would turn green when the position is less than 15cm from the destination. When the distance to destination falls within the precise view threshold, QField emits an audio feedback in the form of a ping with reducing intervals as the current location gets closer to the destination. The audio feedback can be disabled by long-pressing on the bottom-right navigation button, selecting the Precise View Settings menu item, and unchecking Enable Audio Proximity Feedback . It is also possible the precise view to always be visible by long-pressing on the bottom-right navigation button, selecting the Precise View Settings menu item, and checking Always Show Precise View . When enabled, the precise view will appear whenever a navigation destination has been set and will act as a visual compass providing an arrow on the edge of the precision target.","title":"Navigation"},{"location":"how-to/navigation/#navigation","text":"QField offers navigation functionalities to help orient yourself in the field and accurately reach a given destination.","title":"Navigation"},{"location":"how-to/navigation/#activating-navigation","text":"Navigation is enabled when a destination point has been set and positioning is active.

Jobs are created in response to certain user actions. Once a job is created, it is added to the project's job queue and waits for available QFieldCloud resources to run. At any given moment only one job can run per project. The rest of the queued jobs will perform in the same order as in they entered the queue. Each job consists of one or more steps and each step is responsible for one self contained task on the project. QFieldCloud supports three predefined job workflows: process_projectfile , package and delta_apply . While running, jobs are writing log messages which are available on project's jobs page for jobs that have reached a final status FINISHED or FAILED . Jobs have access to project secrets . Note All jobs can be triggered using the QFieldCloud API. Warning Any of the triggering conditions described on this page might change without notice. Warning All jobs must finish within 10 minutes or they will result in a timeout error and will be terminated. Job types \u00b6 Process project file ( process_projectfile ) job \u00b6 The process project file job is used to extract details about the project configuration and project layers, such as project CRS, layer CRS, layer name, layer validity etc. QFieldCloud validates the uploaded QGIS project file ( .qgs / .qgz ), as well as the supporting GeoPackages, TIFFs and other data source files. It also validates remote connection to PostGIS, WFS, WMS and other online data sources. QFieldCloud will open the project file in a QGIS instance on the server to extract all the necessary information. Triggers \u00b6 This job is triggered every time a file is uploaded to QFieldCloud, unless at least one of the following condition are valid: No QGIS project file ( .qgs / .qgz ) has been uploaded yet. The uploaded file is within the DCIM directory. Those files are assumed to be irrelevant to project validity. There is already a process_projectfile job in PENDING status. Troubleshoot \u00b6 A process_projectfile job might result in FAILED status. Check the non-exhaustive list of causes below: The uploaded QGIS project file ( .qgs / .qgz ) is unreadable, incomplete, broken or wrong. Try to reupload the QGIS project file. QGIS is crashing after opening the project file. Try to identify the layer that is causing the crash by removing one layer at time from the project and reuploading the QGIS project file. Note Even if a process_projectfile job results in a SUCCESS status, it does not mean the project is properly configured. The SUCCESS status just states the project has been successfully opened and all the needed information has been extracted. Package ( package ) job \u00b6 The package job convert a QGIS project to a QField project, the same way it is done on QGIS via QFieldSync. The package job will prepare all layers marked as \"Offline editing\" to a single GeoPackage. Triggers \u00b6 This job is triggered every time the Download or Synchronize buttons are pressed on QField. Unless at least one of the following condition are valid: The project has never run a process_projectfile job that resulted in SUCCESS status. There is already a package job in PENDING status. The project does not contain online vector layers (PostGIS, WFS etc), the latest package job result was SUCCESS and there were no file uploads, nor change uploads.

There are hidden files and directories within the project that are preventing the normal work of QFieldCloud. Hidden files and directories are those starting with a leading dot ( . ). Troubleshoot job logs \u00b6 When running a job, usually you can find a step in the logs called \"Check project layers\" that prints a table with all the project layers and status next to them. The possible statuses are: ok - The layer loads correctly on QFieldCloud. invalid_dataprovider - the layer's data provider is invalid.

Each user can create one or more QFieldCloud projects. Each project contains a single .qgs / .qgz QGIS project file, the geospatial files - GeoPackages, Shapefiles, TIFs, and additional data such as photos, PDFs etc. All project data files must be within a single QFieldCloud project. Each QFieldCloud project has a name and an owner. The owner of a project is a QFieldCloud user or an organization. The owner name and project name must be a unique combination within QFieldCloud, which means a user cannot have two projects with the same name. Projects can be marked as public or private. Private projects are accessible only by users that are added as project collaborators. The public projects are visible to anyone on QFieldCloud and they can download the project on their QField device. Creating a project \u00b6 A project can be created in two different ways: either using the QFieldCloud web interface or using QFieldSync in QGIS. Files \u00b6 Files are the skeleton on which QFieldCloud project works. To make a QFieldCloud project alive you need to upload at least a single QGIS project file in the .qgs or .qgz file format. All geospatial files need to be uploaded with the same relative paths as on your computer. If external SVG or raster symbology is used, you need to upload these files too. Note QFieldCloud does not support projects stored in a GeoPackage ( .gpkg ) files. A typical file structure of a QGIS file might look something like this: project \u251c\u2500\u2500 data \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 basemap.tif \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bees.gpkg \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 fields.gpkg \u251c\u2500\u2500 symbology \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 icon.svg \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 line-pattern.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 DCIM \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bees-20220404121212.jpg \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bees-20220405040506.jpg \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 fields-20220405040607.jpg \u2514\u2500\u2500 project.qgs Collaborators \u00b6 A project collaborator is another QFieldCloud user invited to contribute to a project. One project may have multiple collaborators. Collaborators with role owner or admin can add more users as collaborators. If the project is owned by an organization, you can also add teams as collaborators. Read more about collaborator roles . Changes \u00b6 Changes made on vector layers and pushed to QFieldCloud from a QField device will appear here. Each change stores the changed attributes and geometries. Changes have one of the three methods: create - a new feature has been created. delete - an existing feature has been deleted. patch - an existing feature has been modified. Features that have been created and later deleted without being pushed to QFieldCloud will never appear in project changes. Note Changes on online vector layers (PostGIS, WFS) that does not have \"Offline editing\" cloud layer action will not generate a change, but will directly modify the original data source.

There are two types of secrets: Environment variables - Environment variables will be available to QGIS while your project jobs are running. pgservice connection - A PostgreSQL/PostGIS connection as defined in the .pg_service.conf configuration file. If you use multiple service definitions, you should add multiple secrets for each of them.

Project Requirements \u00b6 To facilitate effective field work, regular consultation with the Ecology team is required to ensure that QField projects are prepared appropriately. Firstly, basemaps comprising aerial imagery and proposed development plans are prepared by georeferencing and constructing pyramids in QGIS. Point, line and polygon vector layers are then created to support digitisation and associated data collection. Using a range of widgets, attribute fields are customised to meet the requirements of the Ecology team. These include: Style drop-down list of selectable styles tailored for conducting ecological surveys Scale drop-down list of selectable scales for point and line feature Info space for inserting a feature description Image location for images to be captured and stored Geometry contains self-populated geometry values, e.g. area, perimeter, length Timestamp records the time and date that a feature was created/last modified Figure 1 - Overview of the traditional workflow in ecological surveying at Delta-Simons compared with the workflow created using QField.

Introduction \u00b6 The aim of this paper is to highlight the main benefits of using the QField app. An App that can be installed on an Android device for all archaeologists working in the field. The main feature of this new application will allow the archaeologist to upload to his/her smartphone or tablet the .qgs project of the excavation based on the general information concerning the site that is already available to you. At this point, it is possible to implement the collection of data directly on site, maintaining constant updates to your system, thus allowing you to review the project throughout the excavation process. The \u201cpocket-GIS\u201d with QField is finally a reality! Working with QField in the field allows us to significantly reduce registration and computerisation time of inputting data into the database system, eliminating the digiti- sation of field registers and all related paperwork. The advantage of entrusting all of the information to the main GIS platform of the project (master), which is stored inside the PC, means this leaves only the task of checking the collected data, along with the bonus of in-depth topographical and geospatial analysis. In this article, we will show a practical example of integrated use of QGIS and QField, which relates to an open area excavation. The intervention methodology proposed in this article was constructed by the per- sonal experience of the authors; this specifically refers to open area excavation works in commercial archaeology projects. 2. Main Features of QField \u00b6 QField is an Android app that can be downloaded from Google Play. This application, although it presents itself with a very simple interface, is rich in functions such as: Tools for digitalisation in the field; Geometry and attribute editing; GPS; Possibility to upload custom base maps; Integration of smartphone/tablet\u2019s camera; Many other functions. QField can be considered a \u201cmobile\u201d extension for QGIS. In fact, it allows us to view and manage a GIS project created with QGIS on an Android smartphone or tablet. Permitting the user to keep all set themes, labels and styles that are in the original project (Figure 1). Figure 1 - An example of the same Survey GIS platform project in QGIS (below) and in QField (above). Image by Giuseppe Guarino 2019. Furthermore, similar to QGIS, we can query each layer within QField by obtaining the respective information contained in its attribute table (however, there are also other GIS applications for mobile such as ArcGis, LiPAD, Bentley Map Mobile, GVSig Mobile, Geopaparazzi and others). In order to work with a QGIS project within QField, the first step is to configure the properties of that project created in QGIS as \u201csave relative paths\u201d. You will need to create a folder \u201cfolder_name\u201d on your desktop and save in this path the .qgs file that you want to transfer to the smartphone or tablet; similarly, in the same folder, you have to enter all the data (vectors, raster and database) that make up this .QGIS project. These data can also be divided into further subfolders. Finally, you need to copy the entire folder \u2018folder_name\u2019 to the tablet, following two possible paths: In the internal memory: Android > data > ch.opengis.QField > files > share; In the external SD: Android > data > ch.opengis.QField > files. 3. Working with QField in an Archaeological Survey and Archaeological Risk Assessment Projects \u00b6 Until recently, paper maps were the only way of recording archaeological features and the fields\u2019 visibility in an archaeological survey work. Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards. Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or from different software, reducing time and costs. The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117\u2013143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables: one is spatial, which is useful in the field, and the other is alphanumeric. Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop. This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or, alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries. However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]). This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey. The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information: Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String), Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String). The attribute values, \u201cProject name\u201d and \u201cFeature Number\u201d, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in order to identify only one unique \u201cProject name\u201d and only one \u201cFeature Number\u201d. The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS. The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device. However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna. In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure\u2019s geometric information, measurements and others, besides a buffer of itself. After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the project through the use of the QField Sync plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project file with the * .QGIS extension, the database and the rasters (or the geopackage containing our rasters: IGM, Basemap and so on) into our smartphone or tablet. By default, QField creates a folder where you can save projects (Android/data/ ch.opengis.QField/files), but it is always better to store them on an external SSD, since if you were to uninstall QField from your device, all the folders and files contained in them will be removed running the risk of deleting the data. After we set up the bases of the GIS project in QGIS, we need to export it into QField through a suitable plug-in called QField-Sync. However, we can perform that task even by simply transferring (copy and paste) the QGIS project and the related dataset to our Android device. The QGIS project must be saved as .QGIS. 4. Benefits and Drawbacks of Using QField in an Archaeological Survey and Archaeological Risk Assessment Jobs \u00b6 QField, similar to all the cutting-edge tools, has some limits related the the use of the devices; the main one of these might be caused by the poor bandwidth or lack of internet. In this case, we cannot have a good accuracy in the registration of our archaeological features by using the GNSS. At the same time, we would not to be able to upload WMS services such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map and others. Another disadvantage is related to the battery life: keeping the screen, data connection and GPS always active will drastically reduce the battery life of our device, even if we might bring with us portable powerbanks. On the other hand, the benefits of using QField are a lot; in fact, it allows us to reduce many procedures we were to carry out had we registered the archaeological features identified during the survey on a paper map or had we filled up their related information manually on paper sheets. Furthermore, another benefit constitutes the possibility of using QField for integrating the device camera or a GNSS antenna. All of this makes the collection of data easier and increases their accuracy while at the same time reducing time, costs and workforce. G.G. 5. Working with QField in an Open Area Excavation \u00b6 In an open area excavation scenario, the advantages and convenience of using an App such as QField are innumerable. This is true especially in commercial archaeology sites, where very often the deadlines to carry out the work and the budgets available for the archaeological investigation are very tight. This forces you to work with the maximum optimisation of the timing and assets, despite the fact that the weather and visibility conditions in the field are often poor (Figure 2). Figure 2 - An example of when the weather and visibility conditions in the field are poor. Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. Now, let us see why the use of QField facilitates the reduction of working times and, at the same time, guarantees the saving of resources to be invested in the archaeological investigation, providing a practical example of using the GIS App for Android. In this kind of work, the first step is to strip the area to be investigated with the use of machinery, aiming to remove the topsoil and then eventually the subsoil. The subsequent step involves the identification of archaeological features both directly in the field and by comparing the results of the aerial remote sensing and geophysical analysis when this type of technology is used. The archaeological features identified are then digitally detected by GPS or Total Station. Finally, all the excavation interventions that need to be completed in the investigation area (slots) are outlined, where it is more relevant in terms of understanding the stratigraphic relationship between the archaeological features identified. This phase of the work is called \u201cPre-Ex\u201d. The Pre-Ex survey will be the topographical base for the creation of the GIS platform of the project in QGIS, together with the base map of the area, the TBM\u2019s and any aerial orthophotos of the site. Within the same platform, we will also upload a geodatabase containing the layers necessary for the digitisation of the following: a. The archaeological features identified in the field; b The slots planned; c. The contexts investigated and their related levels; d. The plan and section lines used for the manual drawings; e. All the elements that we may need to detect during the archaeological investigation of the site. However, in the same database, there will also be tables related to the paperwork sheets. Thus, they are comparable to the digital version of the paper registers and other related paperwork that are commonly used on construction sites for excavation documentation. This database (what comes next is just an example of database structure. Tables and geometries can be different according to the characteristics of the sites and the topology of investigations that must be carried out. In any case, tables and vectors must be related to each other in order to interact. QField recognises the project relations set in QGIS.) is made of: Sites (Vector): Contains the list and description of all the sites on which the company is working. Context_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the contexts identified and excavated during the excavation project. Slots (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the slots excavated and contains the information of the paper slot register. Level_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the levels taken during the excavation of each slot. Drawings_Vector (Vector): This layer graphically represents the plan and section lines used for the manual drawings. Drawing_Point (Vector): This layer graphically represents the points through which the plan and section lines pass. Context_Register (No geometry): digital register, which contains all the investigated contexts. Drawings_Register (No geometry): digital register of all the drawings. Permatrace_Register (No geometry): digital register of the permatrace sheets. Sample_Register (No geometry): digital register of the samples collected. Photo_Register (No geometry): digital register of all photos taken. Small_Find_Register (No geometry): digital register of all small finds collected. Finds_Bag_Register (No geometry): digital register of all finds bags collected during the excavation. Context_Sheets (No geometry): This layer is the digital version of the context sheets register and contains all the information related to each context investigated. At this point, we need to simply transfer the master project created in QGIS with all the \u201cproject relation\u201d and \u201cwidgets\u201d to the tablet or the smartphone and manage it directly on site with QField to immediately appreciate its advantages and convenience (Figure 3). Figure 3 - An example of the same open area excavation GIS platform project in QGIS (above) and in QField (below). Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. In fact, primarily, by using this system, archaeologists who are working in the field will be able to directly register the context numbers identified during the excavation within QField, in the appropriate \u201ccontext register\u201d table in the QField database. This aspect already speeds up on-site operations by saving the time generally taken to go back and forth from the site to the compound or from the site to the car/van and vice versa, for the compilation of paper registers; especially, if we take into consideration the fact that, on a regular basis, cars and compounds are located at a considerable distance away from the excavation area. Additionally, since generally there is only one device on site and this is usually held by the site manager or by the supervisors, this would make it easier for them to check that the field archaeologists are assigning the right numbers to the identified contexts. Very often, on a location tend to become confused, especially when the excavation area of the site is poor due to adverse weather conditions. Along with the above issues, they can also encounter errors such as registering the same feature with different cut numbers or by assigning the same context numbers to different features. This occurs even more frequently when the field team is composed of numerous archaeologists who work in separate excavation slots from each other. These slots can be spread around the excavation area, making interaction and communication between them more challenging. This issue is also linked to another problem, which means, for those who work in the field, it is impossible to have a constant overview of the investigation area and the archaeological features identified, which often causes confusion and making mistakes during the registration of the context numbers. Therefore, from this point of view, QField represents a real breakthrough by giving the following possibilities to the people working on site, at any time: i. To have a general overview of the excavation area; ii. To query the surveyed archaeological features; iii. To check the shape and the orientation of the archaeological features identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which must be dug even when the site conditions are poor. QField aids with various challenges encountered in the field: time wasted due to inclement, wet weather and perpetually sodden and muddy soil churned up by people and vehicles continually accessing the site. These cause the identified archaeological features to become unrecognisable after several days of the site being stripped (Figure 2). By using the device\u2019s GPS, as it allows the user to navigate within the excavation area and to find, albeit with a certain margin of error, the archaeological features that need to be excavated, even when the visibility on site is poor. Similarly, by doing so, when visibility conditions are bad, it is easier to centre with the slots in the archaeological features that have previously been identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which prevents the miscalculation of digging into the natural sites. A typical example of this is when there are furrows running across the field, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see their entire length with the naked eye. Typically, in order to remedy this type of problem, archaeologists use printed maps in the excavation area; however, although this can certainly be a help, in practice, they are in no way comparable to the convenience of digital maps and consequently to QField for a number of reasons: Printed maps deteriorate very quickly due to wind, humidity and especially when handled by human hands. To contain the entire excavation area, they must often be printed in very large formats, which requires particular plotters, which incurs considerable costs and makes them difficult to use. Paper maps are not interactive, which means that you cannot ask them questions. They do not solve the problem of having to precisely centre the archaeological features, which need to be investigated with the slots when the visibility conditions on the site are poor. Notably, the use of QField on site simplifies the workload of managers and supervisors in the planning of the excavation interventions, allowing them to easily instruct field archaeologists directly in the excavation area. By doing so, they will be able to train the field team efficiently with accurate information regarding the features that they will have to dig, supporting their explanation with the graphic aid of the tablet and with details related to what has already been investigated and uploaded into the database of the project. Apart from the fieldwork, QField makes the job easier for archaeologists even in the recording phase, simplifying their work in the production of the paperwork. As we already mentioned, they can continuously query the tablet to obtain the necessary information that needs to be included in their paper documentation sheets, such as the section or plan numbers of the contexts that they have excavated, along with the photo numbers of the same contexts, or any other related information. Furthermore, it will be much easier for them to draw the location plans that are generally required in the context sheets, as they will have much more pieces of information available to provide an interpretation of what they have dug. Another very important aspect to take into consideration when working with QField is that there is a possibility of completely removing the manual registration process of the slot numbers, context numbers, drawing numbers, sample numbers, photo numbers and so on. Simultaneously, by using this system, we can also avoid issues such as: The manual data-entry of the paper registers into the database of the project; The problem of deciphering incomprehensible calligraphies, which greatly increase the possibility of making transcription mistakes. In fact, unclear calligraphies are a recurring problem related to the manual recording of the excavation documentation and in particular of the registers. This is also going to affect the accuracy of the information that must be put into the database during computerisation. Additionally, the archaeologist involved in the paperwork must include in his documentation context numbers, drawing numbers and other types of information related to the archaeological features and in relation to his own, which have been excavated and recorded by other colleagues. In this circumstance, to confuse one number for another, perhaps due to the unclear handwriting of the colleague, is a very common mistake. Worst-case scenario means that: There will no longer be a match between digital registers of the database and paper registers; The information on various context sheets will not be reliable; Both cases (as mentioned above). Therefore, we will have to spend a lot of time and effort tracking down the error and correcting it. Instead, the use of a digital recording eliminates this problem and facilitates the checking of errors. The main benefit of the GIS tools is that they enable us to query the features by giving us the possibility to cross-check data, which speeds up the checking process. To give a practical example, if you need to adjust the number of a context, or a drawing or anything else within a digital register by a number, with the QGIS \u201cfield calculator\u201d, it becomes an easy task taking only a few seconds. Just think how long it would take to perform the same task using registers and paperonly documentation, especially when working with considerable amounts of data collected within an extensive excavation. In this case, you must first trace the folder containing the numerical series of the number to be revised, then browse one-by-one all the registers until you find the number that needs to be amended and finally corrected, along with all the subsequent numbers. This will not only need to be corrected in the registers, but also within the specific sections of the context sheets. In other words, if a context, drawing or photo number has been registered incorrectly, it is not enough to correct only the register but also all the paperwork that relates to the number that has been mentioned. Therefore, by using a digital register (table), the operation will only take a few minutes; however, if you were working on the paper documentation by hand, it could take numerous hours of hard work. One final significantly important aspect to take into consideration is the saving of paper and consequently the amount of money involved. The use of QField and digital documentation allows us to efficiently manage the excavation data. By working in this way, it is no longer necessary to print out the survey plans, the registers and the paperwork sheets. However, if the competent authority (county archaeology) or the customer explicitly requests a paper version of all the documentation produced on site, it will be possible to print out everything at the end of the project, only once all of the amendments have been made. This helps to avoid unnecessary waste of paper, along with all the other problems that were previously mentioned. Even in this case, the QGIS \u201cprint composer\u201d allows us to develop customised layouts that can be saved and used at any time. 6. Conclusions \u00b6 In an increasingly digital world, it is unacceptable to continue working on paper especially because, at the end of the process, all paper documentation must be digitised for archiving needs. Today, in fact, both the museums and the warehouses of the archaeological companies have less space available for the storage of paper folders. At this point, it would be beneficial to manage the data in a digital format at the beginning of the excavation process, immediately saving time and resources. Scanning the PDF documents of registers, context sheets and, in general, all documentation produced on site is not a practical and sustainable solution. As previously mentioned, often, this documentation in extensive excavation projects is made up of thousands of paperwork sheets; I challenge anyone to reconstruct an excavation matrix by checking all the stratigraphic reports on the paperwork PDF scan. This kind of job forces you to continually scroll up and down the PDF document in search of the relationships between the various contexts, resulting in a significant waste of time and energy; without any regards to the costs that are involved when scanning in thousands of sheets. Archaeological excavations are constantly driven by strict and increasingly shorter deadlines. The use of GIS for the management of excavation data can no longer be ignored. Currently, the possibility of an \u201cOpen Source\u201d and a \u201cpocket\u201d GIS platform, such as QField, truly represents a unique opportunity to make the work of archaeologists on site easier, faster and more accurate. As previously mentioned, it is much easier to build the matrix and compile the phasing of the archaeological features identified working with a digital system during the Post-Ex phase. Thus, only an instrument such as GIS, which gives us the possibility of launching queries and continuously cross-referencing data, allows us to perform this type of work quickly and efficiently. At the same time, the GIS allows us to have a continuous overview of the data produced on site and to further implement information regarding the investigation by using geospatial analysis, which helps to facilitate the final interpretative reconstruction. In short, the principle of paper lasting forever cannot be accepted any more. Primarily, because it is not true, and secondly, it deteriorates over time, especially when, as in most cases, it is kept in the basements of archives, museums or sites of archaeological companies. In addition, paper documents entail enormous logistical difficulties in terms of sharing and consulting data, in comparison to digital documentation, which can be easily shared. R.M.

Working with QField in the field allows us to significantly reduce registration and computerisation time of inputting data into the database system, eliminating the digiti- sation of field registers and all related paperwork. The advantage of entrusting all of the information to the main GIS platform of the project (master), which is stored inside the PC, means this leaves only the task of checking the collected data, along with the bonus of in-depth topographical and geospatial analysis. In this article, we will show a practical example of integrated use of QGIS and QField, which relates to an open area excavation. The intervention methodology proposed in this article was constructed by the per- sonal experience of the authors; this specifically refers to open area excavation works in commercial archaeology projects.","title":"1. Introduction"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#2-main-features-of-qfield","text":"QField is an Android app that can be downloaded from Google Play. This application, although it presents itself with a very simple interface, is rich in functions such as: Tools for digitalisation in the field; Geometry and attribute editing; GPS; Possibility to upload custom base maps; Integration of smartphone/tablet\u2019s camera; Many other functions. QField can be considered a \u201cmobile\u201d extension for QGIS. In fact, it allows us to view and manage a GIS project created with QGIS on an Android smartphone or tablet. Permitting the user to keep all set themes, labels and styles that are in the original project (Figure 1). Figure 1 - An example of the same Survey GIS platform project in QGIS (below) and in QField (above). Image by Giuseppe Guarino 2019. Furthermore, similar to QGIS, we can query each layer within QField by obtaining the respective information contained in its attribute table (however, there are also other GIS applications for mobile such as ArcGis, LiPAD, Bentley Map Mobile, GVSig Mobile, Geopaparazzi and others). In order to work with a QGIS project within QField, the first step is to configure the properties of that project created in QGIS as \u201csave relative paths\u201d. You will need to create a folder \u201cfolder_name\u201d on your desktop and save in this path the .qgs file that you want to transfer to the smartphone or tablet; similarly, in the same folder, you have to enter all the data (vectors, raster and database) that make up this .QGIS project. These data can also be divided into further subfolders. Finally, you need to copy the entire folder \u2018folder_name\u2019 to the tablet, following two possible paths: In the internal memory: Android > data > ch.opengis.QField > files > share; In the external SD: Android > data > ch.opengis.QField > files.","title":"2. Main Features of QField"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#3-working-with-qfield-in-an-archaeological-survey-and-archaeological-risk-assessment-projects","text":"Until recently, paper maps were the only way of recording archaeological features and the fields\u2019 visibility in an archaeological survey work. Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards. Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or from different software, reducing time and costs. The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi, Terrenato 1994, pp. 117\u2013143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables: one is spatial, which is useful in the field, and the other is alphanumeric. Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop. This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or, alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries. However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]). This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey. The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information: Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String), Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String). The attribute values, \u201cProject name\u201d and \u201cFeature Number\u201d, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in order to identify only one unique \u201cProject name\u201d and only one \u201cFeature Number\u201d. The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS. The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device. However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna. In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure\u2019s geometric information, measurements and others, besides a buffer of itself. After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the project through the use of the QField Sync plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project file with the * .QGIS extension, the database and the rasters (or the geopackage containing our rasters: IGM, Basemap and so on) into our smartphone or tablet. By default, QField creates a folder where you can save projects (Android/data/ ch.opengis.QField/files), but it is always better to store them on an external SSD, since if you were to uninstall QField from your device, all the folders and files contained in them will be removed running the risk of deleting the data. After we set up the bases of the GIS project in QGIS, we need to export it into QField through a suitable plug-in called QField-Sync. However, we can perform that task even by simply transferring (copy and paste) the QGIS project and the related dataset to our Android device. The QGIS project must be saved as .QGIS.","title":"3.

In this case, we cannot have a good accuracy in the registration of our archaeological features by using the GNSS. At the same time, we would not to be able to upload WMS services such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map and others. Another disadvantage is related to the battery life: keeping the screen, data connection and GPS always active will drastically reduce the battery life of our device, even if we might bring with us portable powerbanks. On the other hand, the benefits of using QField are a lot; in fact, it allows us to reduce many procedures we were to carry out had we registered the archaeological features identified during the survey on a paper map or had we filled up their related information manually on paper sheets. Furthermore, another benefit constitutes the possibility of using QField for integrating the device camera or a GNSS antenna. All of this makes the collection of data easier and increases their accuracy while at the same time reducing time, costs and workforce. G.G.","title":"4. Benefits and Drawbacks of Using QField in an Archaeological Survey and Archaeological Risk Assessment Jobs"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#5-working-with-qfield-in-an-open-area-excavation","text":"In an open area excavation scenario, the advantages and convenience of using an App such as QField are innumerable. This is true especially in commercial archaeology sites, where very often the deadlines to carry out the work and the budgets available for the archaeological investigation are very tight. This forces you to work with the maximum optimisation of the timing and assets, despite the fact that the weather and visibility conditions in the field are often poor (Figure 2). Figure 2 - An example of when the weather and visibility conditions in the field are poor. Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. Now, let us see why the use of QField facilitates the reduction of working times and, at the same time, guarantees the saving of resources to be invested in the archaeological investigation, providing a practical example of using the GIS App for Android. In this kind of work, the first step is to strip the area to be investigated with the use of machinery, aiming to remove the topsoil and then eventually the subsoil. The subsequent step involves the identification of archaeological features both directly in the field and by comparing the results of the aerial remote sensing and geophysical analysis when this type of technology is used. The archaeological features identified are then digitally detected by GPS or Total Station. Finally, all the excavation interventions that need to be completed in the investigation area (slots) are outlined, where it is more relevant in terms of understanding the stratigraphic relationship between the archaeological features identified. This phase of the work is called \u201cPre-Ex\u201d. The Pre-Ex survey will be the topographical base for the creation of the GIS platform of the project in QGIS, together with the base map of the area, the TBM\u2019s and any aerial orthophotos of the site. Within the same platform, we will also upload a geodatabase containing the layers necessary for the digitisation of the following: a. The archaeological features identified in the field; b The slots planned; c. The contexts investigated and their related levels; d. The plan and section lines used for the manual drawings; e. All the elements that we may need to detect during the archaeological investigation of the site. However, in the same database, there will also be tables related to the paperwork sheets. Thus, they are comparable to the digital version of the paper registers and other related paperwork that are commonly used on construction sites for excavation documentation. This database (what comes next is just an example of database structure. Tables and geometries can be different according to the characteristics of the sites and the topology of investigations that must be carried out. In any case, tables and vectors must be related to each other in order to interact. QField recognises the project relations set in QGIS.) is made of: Sites (Vector): Contains the list and description of all the sites on which the company is working. Context_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the contexts identified and excavated during the excavation project. Slots (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the slots excavated and contains the information of the paper slot register. Level_Layer (Vector): This layer graphically represents all the levels taken during the excavation of each slot. Drawings_Vector (Vector): This layer graphically represents the plan and section lines used for the manual drawings. Drawing_Point (Vector): This layer graphically represents the points through which the plan and section lines pass. Context_Register (No geometry): digital register, which contains all the investigated contexts. Drawings_Register (No geometry): digital register of all the drawings. Permatrace_Register (No geometry): digital register of the permatrace sheets. Sample_Register (No geometry): digital register of the samples collected. Photo_Register (No geometry): digital register of all photos taken. Small_Find_Register (No geometry): digital register of all small finds collected. Finds_Bag_Register (No geometry): digital register of all finds bags collected during the excavation. Context_Sheets (No geometry): This layer is the digital version of the context sheets register and contains all the information related to each context investigated. At this point, we need to simply transfer the master project created in QGIS with all the \u201cproject relation\u201d and \u201cwidgets\u201d to the tablet or the smartphone and manage it directly on site with QField to immediately appreciate its advantages and convenience (Figure 3). Figure 3 - An example of the same open area excavation GIS platform project in QGIS (above) and in QField (below). Image by Roberto Montagnetti 2019. In fact, primarily, by using this system, archaeologists who are working in the field will be able to directly register the context numbers identified during the excavation within QField, in the appropriate \u201ccontext register\u201d table in the QField database. This aspect already speeds up on-site operations by saving the time generally taken to go back and forth from the site to the compound or from the site to the car/van and vice versa, for the compilation of paper registers; especially, if we take into consideration the fact that, on a regular basis, cars and compounds are located at a considerable distance away from the excavation area. Additionally, since generally there is only one device on site and this is usually held by the site manager or by the supervisors, this would make it easier for them to check that the field archaeologists are assigning the right numbers to the identified contexts. Very often, on a location tend to become confused, especially when the excavation area of the site is poor due to adverse weather conditions. Along with the above issues, they can also encounter errors such as registering the same feature with different cut numbers or by assigning the same context numbers to different features. This occurs even more frequently when the field team is composed of numerous archaeologists who work in separate excavation slots from each other. These slots can be spread around the excavation area, making interaction and communication between them more challenging. This issue is also linked to another problem, which means, for those who work in the field, it is impossible to have a constant overview of the investigation area and the archaeological features identified, which often causes confusion and making mistakes during the registration of the context numbers. Therefore, from this point of view, QField represents a real breakthrough by giving the following possibilities to the people working on site, at any time: i. To have a general overview of the excavation area; ii. To query the surveyed archaeological features; iii. To check the shape and the orientation of the archaeological features identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which must be dug even when the site conditions are poor. QField aids with various challenges encountered in the field: time wasted due to inclement, wet weather and perpetually sodden and muddy soil churned up by people and vehicles continually accessing the site. These cause the identified archaeological features to become unrecognisable after several days of the site being stripped (Figure 2). By using the device\u2019s GPS, as it allows the user to navigate within the excavation area and to find, albeit with a certain margin of error, the archaeological features that need to be excavated, even when the visibility on site is poor. Similarly, by doing so, when visibility conditions are bad, it is easier to centre with the slots in the archaeological features that have previously been identified in the Pre-Ex phase, which prevents the miscalculation of digging into the natural sites. A typical example of this is when there are furrows running across the field, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see their entire length with the naked eye. Typically, in order to remedy this type of problem, archaeologists use printed maps in the excavation area; however, although this can certainly be a help, in practice, they are in no way comparable to the convenience of digital maps and consequently to QField for a number of reasons: Printed maps deteriorate very quickly due to wind, humidity and especially when handled by human hands. To contain the entire excavation area, they must often be printed in very large formats, which requires particular plotters, which incurs considerable costs and makes them difficult to use. Paper maps are not interactive, which means that you cannot ask them questions. They do not solve the problem of having to precisely centre the archaeological features, which need to be investigated with the slots when the visibility conditions on the site are poor. Notably, the use of QField on site simplifies the workload of managers and supervisors in the planning of the excavation interventions, allowing them to easily instruct field archaeologists directly in the excavation area. By doing so, they will be able to train the field team efficiently with accurate information regarding the features that they will have to dig, supporting their explanation with the graphic aid of the tablet and with details related to what has already been investigated and uploaded into the database of the project. Apart from the fieldwork, QField makes the job easier for archaeologists even in the recording phase, simplifying their work in the production of the paperwork. As we already mentioned, they can continuously query the tablet to obtain the necessary information that needs to be included in their paper documentation sheets, such as the section or plan numbers of the contexts that they have excavated, along with the photo numbers of the same contexts, or any other related information. Furthermore, it will be much easier for them to draw the location plans that are generally required in the context sheets, as they will have much more pieces of information available to provide an interpretation of what they have dug. Another very important aspect to take into consideration when working with QField is that there is a possibility of completely removing the manual registration process of the slot numbers, context numbers, drawing numbers, sample numbers, photo numbers and so on. Simultaneously, by using this system, we can also avoid issues such as: The manual data-entry of the paper registers into the database of the project; The problem of deciphering incomprehensible calligraphies, which greatly increase the possibility of making transcription mistakes. In fact, unclear calligraphies are a recurring problem related to the manual recording of the excavation documentation and in particular of the registers. This is also going to affect the accuracy of the information that must be put into the database during computerisation. Additionally, the archaeologist involved in the paperwork must include in his documentation context numbers, drawing numbers and other types of information related to the archaeological features and in relation to his own, which have been excavated and recorded by other colleagues. In this circumstance, to confuse one number for another, perhaps due to the unclear handwriting of the colleague, is a very common mistake. Worst-case scenario means that: There will no longer be a match between digital registers of the database and paper registers; The information on various context sheets will not be reliable; Both cases (as mentioned above). Therefore, we will have to spend a lot of time and effort tracking down the error and correcting it. Instead, the use of a digital recording eliminates this problem and facilitates the checking of errors. The main benefit of the GIS tools is that they enable us to query the features by giving us the possibility to cross-check data, which speeds up the checking process. To give a practical example, if you need to adjust the number of a context, or a drawing or anything else within a digital register by a number, with the QGIS \u201cfield calculator\u201d, it becomes an easy task taking only a few seconds. Just think how long it would take to perform the same task using registers and paperonly documentation, especially when working with considerable amounts of data collected within an extensive excavation. In this case, you must first trace the folder containing the numerical series of the number to be revised, then browse one-by-one all the registers until you find the number that needs to be amended and finally corrected, along with all the subsequent numbers. This will not only need to be corrected in the registers, but also within the specific sections of the context sheets. In other words, if a context, drawing or photo number has been registered incorrectly, it is not enough to correct only the register but also all the paperwork that relates to the number that has been mentioned. Therefore, by using a digital register (table), the operation will only take a few minutes; however, if you were working on the paper documentation by hand, it could take numerous hours of hard work. One final significantly important aspect to take into consideration is the saving of paper and consequently the amount of money involved. The use of QField and digital documentation allows us to efficiently manage the excavation data. By working in this way, it is no longer necessary to print out the survey plans, the registers and the paperwork sheets. However, if the competent authority (county archaeology) or the customer explicitly requests a paper version of all the documentation produced on site, it will be possible to print out everything at the end of the project, only once all of the amendments have been made. This helps to avoid unnecessary waste of paper, along with all the other problems that were previously mentioned. Even in this case, the QGIS \u201cprint composer\u201d allows us to develop customised layouts that can be saved and used at any time.","title":"5. Working with QField in an Open Area Excavation"},{"location":"success-stories/heritage-impact-assessment/#6-conclusions","text":"In an increasingly digital world, it is unacceptable to continue working on paper especially because, at the end of the process, all paper documentation must be digitised for archiving needs. Today, in fact, both the museums and the warehouses of the archaeological companies have less space available for the storage of paper folders. At this point, it would be beneficial to manage the data in a digital format at the beginning of the excavation process, immediately saving time and resources. Scanning the PDF documents of registers, context sheets and, in general, all documentation produced on site is not a practical and sustainable solution. As previously mentioned, often, this documentation in extensive excavation projects is made up of thousands of paperwork sheets; I challenge anyone to reconstruct an excavation matrix by checking all the stratigraphic reports on the paperwork PDF scan. This kind of job forces you to continually scroll up and down the PDF document in search of the relationships between the various contexts, resulting in a significant waste of time and energy; without any regards to the costs that are involved when scanning in thousands of sheets. Archaeological excavations are constantly driven by strict and increasingly shorter deadlines. The use of GIS for the management of excavation data can no longer be ignored. Currently, the possibility of an \u201cOpen Source\u201d and a \u201cpocket\u201d GIS platform, such as QField, truly represents a unique opportunity to make the work of archaeologists on site easier, faster and more accurate. As previously mentioned, it is much easier to build the matrix and compile the phasing of the archaeological features identified working with a digital system during the Post-Ex phase. Thus, only an instrument such as GIS, which gives us the possibility of launching queries and continuously cross-referencing data, allows us to perform this type of work quickly and efficiently. At the same time, the GIS allows us to have a continuous overview of the data produced on site and to further implement information regarding the investigation by using geospatial analysis, which helps to facilitate the final interpretative reconstruction. In short, the principle of paper lasting forever cannot be accepted any more. Primarily, because it is not true, and secondly, it deteriorates over time, especially when, as in most cases, it is kept in the basements of archives, museums or sites of archaeological companies. In addition, paper documents entail enormous logistical difficulties in terms of sharing and consulting data, in comparison to digital documentation, which can be easily shared. R.M.

Annually, the Schutzstation Wattenmeer participates in the Wadden Sea wide trilateral monitoring and assessment program (TMAP) and monitors the number of breeding birds in more than 100 monitoring areas in Schleswig-Holstein / Germany. For a number of species we monitor a significant share of the entire German breeding population. Sketch of the project and the monitoring areas of Schutzstation Wattenmeer (yellow). Most fieldwork is carried out by annually changing volunteers which usually do not have much experience. Good supervision during the monitoring period in spring is thus very important. At the same time the amount of collected data is a significant bureaucratic challenge. Until 2018 printed paper maps were used to collect the data in the field. Major disadvantages of the analogue system were: orientation in the field was rather difficult without GPS positioning all results had to be counted and transferred to data tables and GIS manually, transmission errors were likely (about 18,000 observations are collected every year) data could only be reviewed after the monitoring period and unlikely observations could not be checked directly For this reason, we have implemented a digital monitoring workflow using the power of QField, the advantages of a cloud storage system and the computational power of R. Most tasks are now fully automatized in R. Via the cloud data from all areas can be accessed and evaluated with daily topicality. Sketch of the data transmission system. Field observations are logged in QField on a tablet and uploaded into a cloud storage. Data from all areas are accessed and automatically treated by an R script. In spring 2019 we tested our system with seven tablet devices spread over seven of in total 12 different monitoring stations. Project preparation \u00b6 On a desktop computer we set up a QGIS project containing a high-resolution aerial image as background layer for orientation in the field. For the monitoring data we created a custom Geopackage database with predefined dropdown columns and entry restrictions. Additionally, we added predefined walking paths to guide the volunteers and to further standardise our monitoring. Sketch of the QField Interface. For data entry we used a geopackage file with custom dropdown list and entry restrictions. Logged observations are clearly laid out in QField. We used an additional synchronisation App that automatically uploaded the field data from the tablet to a Google Drive cloud after fieldwork. For data download, automatized backup, data review and export we wrote a R script. After data was automatically synchronized with the cloud the results from all the different areas can be reviewed via a custom R script. Also visual review of the collected data is possible via R. The general concept of QField as a simplified field application of QGIS turned out to be very useful for our work with volunteers. While we can set up a project with a high level of customization including all our needs in QGIS, field workers only need to understand the basics. A big advantage: unwanted changes are almost impossible in QField.

The use of the custom QField project was evaluated as straightforward and easy. In total more than 18.000 data points were collected in the field.

Annually, the Schutzstation Wattenmeer participates in the Wadden Sea wide trilateral monitoring and assessment program (TMAP) and monitors the number of breeding birds in more than 100 monitoring areas in Schleswig-Holstein / Germany. For a number of species we monitor a significant share of the entire German breeding population. Sketch of the project and the monitoring areas of Schutzstation Wattenmeer (yellow). Most fieldwork is carried out by annually changing volunteers which usually do not have much experience. Good supervision during the monitoring period in spring is thus very important. At the same time the amount of collected data is a significant bureaucratic challenge. Until 2018 printed paper maps were used to collect the data in the field. Major disadvantages of the analogue system were: orientation in the field was rather difficult without GPS positioning all results had to be counted and transferred to data tables and GIS manually, transmission errors were likely (about 18,000 observations are collected every year) data could only be reviewed after the monitoring period and unlikely observations could not be checked directly For this reason, we have implemented a digital monitoring workflow using the power of QField, the advantages of a cloud storage system and the computational power of R. Most tasks are now fully automatized in R. Via the cloud data from all areas can be accessed and evaluated with daily topicality. Sketch of the data transmission system. Field observations are logged in QField on a tablet and uploaded into a cloud storage. Data from all areas are accessed and automatically treated by an R script. In spring 2019 we tested our system with seven tablet devices spread over seven of in total 12 different monitoring stations.","title":"Goal and field constraints"},{"location":"success-stories/mapping-breeding-birds-in-the-Wadden-Sea/#project-preparation","text":"On a desktop computer we set up a QGIS project containing a high-resolution aerial image as background layer for orientation in the field. For the monitoring data we created a custom Geopackage database with predefined dropdown columns and entry restrictions. Additionally, we added predefined walking paths to guide the volunteers and to further standardise our monitoring. Sketch of the QField Interface. For data entry we used a geopackage file with custom dropdown list and entry restrictions. Logged observations are clearly laid out in QField. We used an additional synchronisation App that automatically uploaded the field data from the tablet to a Google Drive cloud after fieldwork. For data download, automatized backup, data review and export we wrote a R script. After data was automatically synchronized with the cloud the results from all the different areas can be reviewed via a custom R script. Also visual review of the collected data is possible via R. The general concept of QField as a simplified field application of QGIS turned out to be very useful for our work with volunteers. While we can set up a project with a high level of customization including all our needs in QGIS, field workers only need to understand the basics. A big advantage: unwanted changes are almost impossible in QField.","title":"Project preparation"},{"location":"success-stories/mapping-breeding-birds-in-the-Wadden-Sea/#field-work","text":"During field work orientation was much easier on the tablets compared to printed paper maps especially in the extensive salt marshes.

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation \u00b6 We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data. We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work \u00b6 On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. 3 land cover parcels that were digitalized on the ground Getting back to one parcel: which information was collected Digitalizing a new parcel and filling the attribute table On the field work using Qfield","title":"Data collection of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"success-stories/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#use-of-qfield-in-the-context-of-ground-truth-data-collection-work-of-malaria-transmitting-mosquitoes","text":"By Paul Taconet, GIS Engineer, French Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) 11.12.2018","title":"Use of Qfield in the context of ground-truth data collection work of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"success-stories/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#goal-and-field-constraints","text":"For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast.

Vanilla is an important commercial crop in Vava'u. The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making. Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced. Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island.
